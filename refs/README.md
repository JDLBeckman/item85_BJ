This directory contains references for the two `.pokemongo` programs in the parent directory.
They are identical to the Go programs that are temporarily created when `pokemon-go` is run on 
those `.pokemongo` files, but they are not referenced in any way by the `pokemon-go` script, 
and there does not need to be a corresponding reference in this file in order for `pokemon-go`
to work properly.
