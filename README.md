# TL; DR
`./pokemon-go run welcome.pokemongo`

# What is this?
`pokemon-go` is a script which takes a file with a `.pokemongo` extension, translates it to Go, and then runs using whatever other arguments you passed it as though they were passed to the usual `go` command.
It's as dumb as it sounds, and that's what you're here for.

# Known Bugs
please don't use Go keywords as variable names in your Pokémon-Go code, it scares the Pokémon

nobody could have possibly predicted a bug as extremely difficult to fix as this one
